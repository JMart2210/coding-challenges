# Codewars and Exercism Solutions
Solutions to Codewars problems that I've completed - Each one includes a link to the problem, the instructions, my thought process before solving, the solution I came up with, and the test cases I used.
Exercism problems are completed in-browser, so I included a link to my Exercism profile.
