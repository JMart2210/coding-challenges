# Codeing Challenges
Solutions to Codewars, leetcode, and exercism problems that I've completed - Each one includes a link to the problem and the instructions. Sometimes I include my thought process before solving, followed by the solution I came up with, and the test cases I used.
To get more comfortable with testing I implemented Jest in this directory so that I can run test cases while I'm writing the code.
